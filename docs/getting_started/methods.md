# Ensemble methods

- table of methods that exist for all ensembles and what they do
  - possibly link to scipy for more information on those methods that are inherited from scipy classes (though we will have a description here as well)
- should this just be the Ensemble class API docs? Or are we trying to impart more information than that?
  - definitely should link to that
