# Contribution Guidelines

## Conventions to follow

### Naming

- name_pdf for parameterizations

### Placement

- parameterizations go in the parameterizations folder
- analytic parameterizations go in a separate folder
- if you have one that needs supporting functions, create a folder and place the class file and the supporting files in that folder
- conversion functions go in the conversion_funcs file

## Tests

- what is expected in terms of code coverage, what tests need to be written, types of tests, etc
- tests should exist purely in test folder
- test data stored in tests/test_data
  - what test data should look like
- output of tests should be written to temporary path for ease of clean up

## Documentation

- every function should have docstrings describing what the function does
- what is expected in terms of documentation upkeep (i.e. if you change something and the documentation is now out of date)
