# Cookbook

This is for instructions on how to do a few commonly performed operations

For example:
* creating a qp ensemble from a scipy stats distribution (or instead include this as a parameterization)
* sampling from a pdf 
* a conversion example 
* iterating over a qp ensemble 
* plotting a specific pdf from an ensemble
