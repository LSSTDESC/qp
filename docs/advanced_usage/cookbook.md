# Cookbook

This is for instructions on how to do a few commonly performed operations. If these are short they can just be code examples, but some of the more complicated ones will be links to jupyter notebooks

Some examples:
* creating a qp ensemble from a scipy stats distribution (or instead include this as a parameterization)
* sampling from a pdf 
* adding an ensemble to another ensemble (both a one-distribution ensemble and one with more distributions)
* a conversion example, where we convert from one parameterization to another and then back again and compare the output 
* iterating over a qp ensemble 
* plotting a specific pdf from an ensemble 
* read in ensemble file in h5py, look at what's in the file, and then read it in qp
