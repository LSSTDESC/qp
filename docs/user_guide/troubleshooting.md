# Troubleshooting

- This is the place to go when you're not sure what's going wrong
- also goes over a few common mistakes

Topics to include:

- normalization
- making sure your coordinates cover the range of data for all the distributions in your ensemble
- scipy updates (major updates in scipy can cause errors)
- any known issues/things to watch for
  - quant parameterization's interpolation can go negative
