# Parameterizations

The pages below provide an overview of the five main supported `qp` parameterizations:

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:

hist.md
interp.md
irregularinterp.md
mixmod.md
quant.md

```

There exist additional parameterizations, however they are in various stages of completeness and are not guaranteed to work with all of the functions described in the documentation. For more information about these parameterizations see the parameterization [API documentation](#qp.parameterizations.hist.hist.hist_gen).

## SciPy stats parameterizations

Add in a table here with all of the scipy.stats parameterizations that are available, with links to their docstrings, similar to what exists in scipy.stats?
