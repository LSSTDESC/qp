# Cookbook

This cookbook is a reference page for a variety of `qp` use cases. The <project:ensemblemanipulation> page contains examples of `Ensemble` creation and basic usage. The <project:datamanipulation> covers examples that access or modify the underlying `Ensemble` data in some way. The <project:conversion> page covers conversion examples between the different parameterization types.
