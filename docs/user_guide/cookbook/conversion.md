# Conversion

This page contains example use cases of converting `Ensembles` to different parameterizations.

## Conversion tutorial

This tutorial covers converting between a few different parameterizations and how this affects the distributions in the `Ensemble` across different parameterizations and conversion methods: <project:../../nb/conversion_example.md> (download [here](../../nb/conversion_example.ipynb)).

## Converting a Gaussian `Ensemble` to a histogram

## Converting a Gaussian `Ensemble` to an interpolation

## Converting a Gaussian `Ensemble` to a quantile

## Converting a histogram `Ensemble` to a Gaussian mixture model
