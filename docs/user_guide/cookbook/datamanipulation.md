# Data manipulation

This notebook covers use cases of accessing and manipulating the data contained in `Ensembles` and `Ensemble` files.

## What's in an Ensemble file

This tutorial notebook does an in-depth look of what the actual data structure of an `Ensemble` file looks like, and how to create one from data tables: <project:../../nb/ensemble_file.md> (download [here](../../nb/ensemble_file.ipynb)).

## Accessing the bins and pdf values of a histogram `Ensemble`

## Accessing the x and y values of an interpolation `Ensemble`

## Accessing the quantiles and locations of a quantile `Ensemble`

## Updating the data in an `Ensemble`

## Normalizing an `Ensemble`
